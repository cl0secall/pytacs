class Authorization(Packet):

   11.  Authorization

   TACACS+ authorization is an extensible way of providing remote

   authorization services.  An authorization session is defined as a
   single pair of messages, a REQUEST followed by a RESPONSE.

   The authorization REQUEST message contains a fixed set of fields that
   describe the authenticity of the user or process, and a variable set
   of arguments that describes the services and options for which
   authorization is requested.

   The RESPONSE contains a variable set of response arguments
   (attribute-value pairs) which can restrict or modify the clients
   actions.

   The arguments in both a REQUEST and a RESPONSE can be specified as
   either mandatory or optional. An optional argument is one that may or
   may not be used, modified or even understood by the recipient.

   A mandatory argument MUST be both understood and used. This allows
   for extending the attribute list while providing secure backwards
   compatibility.

authen_method

   This indicates the authentication method used by the client to
   acquire the user information.

   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_METH_NOT_SET    := 0x00

   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_METH_NONE       := 0x01

   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_METH_KRB4       := 0x11

   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_METH_RCMD       := 0x20


   KRB5 and KRB4 are kerberos version 5 and 4. LINE refers to a fixed
   password associated with the line used to gain access. LOCAL is a NAS
   local user database. ENABLE is a command that authenticates in order
   to grant new privileges. TACACSPLUS is, of course, TACACS+. GUEST is
   an unqualified guest authentication, such as an ARAP guest login.
   RADIUS is the Radius authentication protocol. RCMD refers to authen-
   tication provided via the R-command protocols from Berkeley Unix.
   (One should be aware of the security limitations to R-command authen-
   tication.)

priv_lvl

   This field matches the priv_lvl field in the authentication section
   above. It indicates the users current privilege level.

authen_type

   This field matches the authen_type field in the authentication sec-
   tion above. It indicates the type of authentication that was per-
   formed.

authen_service

   This field matches the service field in the authentication section
   above. It indicates the service through which the user authenticated.

user

   This field contains the user's account name.

port

   This field matches the port field in the authentication section
   above.

rem_addr

   This field matches the rem_addr field in the authentication section
   above.

arg_cnt

   The number of authorization arguments to follow

arg

   An attribute-value pair that describes the command to be performed.
   (see below)

   The authorization arguments in both the REQUEST and the RESPONSE are
   attribute-value pairs. The attribute and the value are in a single
   ascii string and are separated by either a "=" (0X3D) or a "*"
   (0X2A). The equals sign indicates a mandatory argument. The asterisk
   indicates an optional one.

   Optional arguments are ones that may be disregarded by either client
   or daemon. Mandatory arguments require that the receiving side under-
   stands the attribute and will act on it. If the client receives a
   mandatory argument that it cannot oblige or does not understand, it
   MUST consider the authorization to have failed. It is legal to send
   an attribute-value pair with a NULL (zero length) value.

   Attribute-value strings are not NULL terminated, rather their length
   value indicates their end. The maximum length of an attribute-value
   string is 255 characters. The following attributes are defined:



   12.  Table 1: Attribute-value Pairs


service

   The primary service. Specifying a service attribute indicates that
   this is a request for authorization or accounting of that service.
   Current values are "slip", "ppp", "arap", "shell", "tty-daemon",
   "connection", "system" and "firewall". This attribute MUST always be
   included.

protocol

   a protocol that is a subset of a service. An example would be any PPP
   NCP. Currently known values are "lcp", "ip", "ipx", "atalk", "vines",
   "lat", "xremote", "tn3270", "telnet", "rlogin", "pad", "vpdn", "ftp",
   "http", "deccp", "osicp" and "unknown".

cmd

   a shell (exec) command. This indicates the command name for a shell
   command that is to be run. This attribute MUST be specified if ser-
   vice equals "shell". A NULL value indicates that the shell itself is
   being referred to.

cmd-arg

   an argument to a shell (exec) command. This indicates an argument for
   the shell command that is to be run. Multiple cmd-arg attributes may
   be specified, and they are order dependent.

acl

   ASCII number representing a connection access list. Used only when
   service=shell and cmd=NULL

inacl

   ASCII identifier for an interface input access list.

outacl

   ASCII identifier for an interface output access list.

zonelist

   A numeric zonelist value. (Applicable to AppleTalk only).

addr

   a network address

addr-pool

   The identifier of an address pool from which the NAS should assign an
   address.

routing

   A boolean. Specifies whether routing information is to be propagated
   to, and accepted from this interface.

route

   Indicates a route that is to be applied to this interface. Values
   MUST be of the form "<dst_address> <mask> [<routing_addr>]". If a
   <routing_addr> is not specified, the resulting route should be via
   the requesting peer.

timeout

   an absolute timer for the connection (in minutes). A value of zero
   indicates no timeout.

idletime

   an idle-timeout for the connection (in minutes). A value of zero
   indicates no timeout.

autocmd

   an auto-command to run. Used only when service=shell and cmd=NULL

noescape

   Boolean. Prevents user from using an escape character. Used only when
   service=shell and cmd=NULL

nohangup

   Boolean. Do no disconnect after an automatic command. Used only when
   service=shell and cmd=NULL

priv_lvl

   privilege level to be assigned.

remote_user

   remote userid (authen_method must have the value
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_METH_RCMD)

remote_host

   remote host (authen_method must have the value
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_METH_RCMD)

callback-dialstring

   Indicates that callback should be done. Value is NULL, or a dial-
   string. A NULL value indicates that the service MAY choose to get the
   dialstring through other means.

callback-line

   The line number to use for a callback.

callback-rotary

   The rotary number to use for a callback.

nocallback-verify

   Do not require authentication after callback.


For all boolean attributes, valid values are "true" or "false". A

value of NULL means an attribute with a zero length string for its value
i.e. cmd=NULL is actually transmitted as the string of 4 characters
"cmd=".

If a host is specified in a cmd-arg or addr, it is recommended that it
be specified as a numeric address so as to avoid any ambiguities.

In the case of rcmd authorizations, the authen_method will be set to
TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_METH_RCMD and the remote_user and remote_host attributes
will provide the remote user and host information to enable rhost style
authorization. The response may request that a privilege level be set
for the user.

The protocol attribute is intended for use with PPP. When service equals
"ppp" and protocol equals "lcp", the message describes the PPP link
layer service. For other values of protocol, this describes a PPP NCP
(network layer service). A single PPP session can support multiple NCPs.

The attributes addr, inacl, outacl, route and routing may be used for
all network protocol types that are supported. Their format and meaning
is determined by the values of the service or protocol attributes. Not
all are necessarily implemented for any given network protocol.

arg_cnt

   The number of authorization arguments to follow.

arg

   An attribute-value pair that describes the command to be performed. (see
   below)

   If the status equals TAC_PLUS_AUTHOR_STATUS_FAIL, then the appropriate
   action is to deny the user action.

   If the status equals TAC_PLUS_AUTHOR_STATUS_PASS_ADD, then the
   arguments specified in the request are authorized and the arguments in
   the response are to be used IN ADDITION to those arguments.

   If the status equals TAC_PLUS_AUTHOR_STATUS_PASS_REPL then the
   arguments in the request are to be completely replaced by the
   arguments in the response.

   If the intended action is to approve the authorization with no
   modifications, then the status should be set to
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHOR_STATUS_PASS_ADD and the arg_cnt should be set to
   0.

   A status of TAC_PLUS_AUTHOR_STATUS_ERROR indicates an error occurred
   on the daemon.

   When the status equals TAC_PLUS_AUTHOR_STATUS_FOLLOW, then the arg_cnt
   MUST be 0. In that case, the actions to be taken and the contents of
   the data field are identical to the TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FOLLOW
   status for Authentication.

   None of the arg values have any relevance if an ERROR is set.

   13.  Accounting

   TACACS+ accounting is very similar to authorization. The packet for-

   that authorization uses, and adds several more.

   All other fields are defined in the authorization and authentication
   sections above and have the same semantics.

   The following new attributes are defined for TACACS+ accounting only.
   When these attribute-value pairs are included in the argument list,
   they should precede any attribute-value pairs that are defined in the
   authorization section above.

Table 2: Accounting Attribute-value Pairs


task_id

   Start and stop records for the same event MUST have matching (unique)
   task_id's

start_time

   The time the action started (in seconds since the epoch, 12:00am Jan
   1 1970).

stop_time

   The time the action stopped (in seconds since the epoch.)

elapsed_time

   The elapsed time in seconds for the action. Useful when the device
   does not keep real time.

timezone

   The timezone abbreviation for all timestamps included in this packet.

event

   Used only when "service=system". Current values are "net_acct",
   "cmd_acct", "conn_acct", "shell_acct" "sys_acct" and "clock_change".
   These indicate system level changes. The flags field SHOULD indicate
   whether the service started or stopped.

reason

   Accompanies an event attribute. It describes why the event occurred.

bytes

   The number of bytes transferred by this action

bytes_in

   The number of input bytes transferred by this action

bytes_out

   The number of output bytes transferred by this action

paks

   The number of packets transferred by this action.

paks_in

   The number of input packets transferred by this action.

paks_out

   The number of output packets transferred by this action.

status

   The numeric status value associated with the action. This is a signed
   four (4) byte word in network byte order. 0 is defined as success.
   Negative numbers indicate errors. Positive numbers indicate non-error
   failures. The exact status values may be defined by the client.

err_msg

   An ascii string describing the status of the action.

   NOTE: All numeric values in an attribute-value string are provided as
   decimal ASCII numbers.

   13.2.  The accounting REPLY packet body

   The response to an accounting message is used to  indicate  that  the
   accounting   function  on  the  daemon  has  completed  and  securely
   committed the record. This provides  the  client  the  best  possible
   guarantee that the data is indeed logged.

status

   This is the return status. Values are:
   TAC_PLUS_ACCT_STATUS_SUCCESS    := 0x01

   TAC_PLUS_ACCT_STATUS_ERROR      := 0x02

   TAC_PLUS_ACCT_STATUS_FOLLOW     := 0x21

server_msg

   This is an ASCII string that may be presented to the user. The deci-
   sion to present this message is client specific.

data

   This is an ASCII string that may be presented on an administrative
   display, console or log. The decision to present this message is
   client specific.

   When the status equals TAC_PLUS_ACCT_STATUS_FOLLOW, then the actions
   to be taken and the contents of the data field are identical to the

   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FOLLOW status for Authentication.

   The daemon MUST terminate the session after sending a REPLY.

   The TAC_PLUS_ACCT_FLAG_START flag indicates that this is a start
   accounting message. Start messages should only be sent once when a
   task is started. The TAC_PLUS_ACCT_FLAG_STOP indicates that this is a
   stop record and that the task has terminated. The
   TAC_PLUS_ACCT_FLAG_WATCHDOG flag means that this is an update record.
   Update records are sent at the client's discretion when the task is
   still running.

   The START and STOP flags are mutually exclusive. When the WATCHDOG
   flag is set along with the START flag, it indicates that the update
   record is a duplicate of the original START record. If the START flag
   is not set, then this indicates a minimal record indicating only that
   task is still running. The STOP flag MUST NOT be set in conjunction
   with the WATCHDOG flag.

   14.  Compatibility between Minor Versions 0 and 1

   Whenever a TACACS+ daemon receives a packet with a minor_version that
   it does not support, it should return an ERROR status with the
   minor_version set to the supported value closest to the requested
   value.

   The changes between minor_version 0 and 1 all deal with the way that
   CHAP, ARAP and PAP authentications are handled.

   In minor_version 0, CHAP, ARAP and outbound PAP authentications were
   performed by the NAS sending a SENDPASS packet to the daemon. The
   SENDPASS requested a copy of the user's plaintext password so that
   the NAS could complete the authentication. The CHAP hashing and ARAP
   encryption were all performed on the NAS. Inbound PAP performed a
   normal LOGIN, sending the username in the START packet and then wait-
   ing for a GETPASS and sending the password in a CONTINUE packet.

   In minor_version 1, CHAP, ARAP and inbound PAP use LOGIN to perform
   inbound authentication and the exchanges use the data field so that
   the NAS only sends a single START packet and expects to receive a
   PASS or FAIL. SENDPASS has been deprecated and SENDAUTH introduced,
   so that the NAS can request authentication credentials for authenti-
   cating to a remote peer. SENDAUTH is only used for PPP when perform-
   ing outbound authentication.

   NOTE: Only those requests which have changed from their minor_version
   0 implementation (i.e. ARAP, CHAP and PAP) should use the new
   minor_version number of 1. All other requests (whose implementation
   has not changed) MUST continue to use the same minor_version number
   of 0 that they have always used.

   If a daemon or NAS implementation desires to provide support for
   minor_number 0 TACACS+ hosts, it MUST pay attention to the
   minor_version in the TACACS+ header (as it should anyway) and be
   prepared to support the SENDPASS operation.

   The removal of SENDPASS was prompted by security concerns, and imple-
   mentors should think very carefully about how they wish to provide
   this service. On a NAS, the minor_version 0 compatibility can be lay-
   ered such that higher layers only need to understand the
   minor_version 1 methodology, with the compatibility layer translating
   requests appropriately when contacting an older daemon.

   On a TACACS+ server, when detecting minor_number 0, the daemon should
   allow for PAP authentications that do not send the password in the
   data field, but instead expect to read the PAP password from a subse-
   quent CONTINUE packet.

   If the daemon supports SENDPASS, then it should be prepared to handle
   such requests for CHAP and ARAP and even PAP, when outbound authenti-
   cation takes place.


   15.  Notes to Implementors

   For those interested in integrating one-time password support into
   TACACS+ daemons, there are some subtleties to consider.  TACACS+ is
   designed to make this straightforward, but two cases require some
   extra care.

   One-time password support with ARAP and PPP's CHAP authentication
   protocols is NOT straightforward, but there are work arounds. The
   problem lies in the nature of ARAP and CHAP authentication. Both
   employ a challenge-response protocol that requires a copy of the
   cleartext password to be stored at both ends. Unfortunately, due to
   their cryptographic nature, one-time password systems can rarely pro-
   vide the cleartext version of the next password.

   A simple workaround is to have the user enter their username as a
   combination of the username and the one-time password, separated by a
   special character, and a fixed password can be used in the password
   field. The fixed password can be assigned on a per user basis or as a
   single site-wide password.

   For the separator character, Cisco Systems has been using the `*'
   (asterisk) character. After some deliberation, it was decided that it
   was the least likely character to be found in a username.
